			<h2>About me</h2>
			<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Hello, my name is Marsalis George Qualls. I'm a recent college graduate from Michigan State University, where I'd studied Media and Information specializing in Interactive and Social Media along with General Business Administration. My current focus is on Website Development specifically on front-end web designs. The reason why I would like to work in a field such as this is because of the constant change, with technology, coding techniques and overall demonstration. With a career such as web development, nothing would be the same, so nothing will get boring within the field.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was born and raised in the city of Detroit, Michigan, with two wonderful, hard-working parents, Monica and Eugene Qualls, and one sister, Eugenia. I first attended school at Burton International starting in kindergarten all the way until 8th grade, and later attended Cass Technical High School, studying Manufacturing Technology. With this as a major, I've learned about designing, both manual and by computer, while using AutoCad and Inventor Professional.</p>
			<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During High School, I recieved my first job at Detroit Golf Club, at the age of 14, as a caddie, and at the age of 16, further the title as a Golf Service Staff. While my time there, I've met wonderful people, full of knowledge and wisdom that they graciously passed upon the many caddies and staff. At the end of my senior year of High School, I've recieved a full ride scholarship, Forest Akers Scholarship, to attend Michigan State University, even though I'm a true Michigan Fan.</p>
